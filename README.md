# Advent of Code 2019

My solutions for the fifth installment of [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com).

## Creating the 'packages'

I've prepared a _Template_ that can be used for each day, containing a package 
of type `executable`. Just copy the template and set the correct number where 
_NN_ is used.

## Running the solutions

Simply run `swift run` in a folder to run the solution and get the answers. For
better perfomance use `swift run -c release`.

For most days I've created unit-tests based on the example inputs. Run those
with `swift test`.
